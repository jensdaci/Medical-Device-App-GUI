I. File List
----------------
GripApp.exe			Application file that can
				run on any Windows computer. 

GripGUI.py			Python file that creates the
				homepage GUI.

arduino_graphing_3sensors.py	Python file that graphs the 
				serial data taken from the

II. How to Run
-----------------
Steps:
	1. Download all files to your computer. 
	2. Make sure they are all on the same folder (directory). 
	3. Connect the arduino with the sensors attached to 
	   the computer. 
	4. Double-click on GripApp.exe
	5. Enter first name, last name, and date of test
	6. Press START TEST
	7. On the console screen (CMD) type the COM_PORT 
	   associated with the connected arduino (can be found 
	   at the bottom of the arduino IDE application)
	8. Press ENTER 
	9. Observe the graph as it changes while more pressure 
	   is put on the sensors. 


In order to make changes to the code the following files can be modified:
 
	1. GripGUI.py
	2. arduino_graphing_3sensors.py
